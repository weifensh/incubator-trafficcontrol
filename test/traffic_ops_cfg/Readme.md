# Traffic Ops Config File / Snapshot Compare

This test allows you to compare all generated config files and CDN snapshots (CRConfig.json) from 2 instances of Traffic Ops. For example, you could compare config files / snapshots of a MySQL vs Postgres Traffic Ops. You could even compare across releases (1.7.0 vs 1.8.0).

*Prerequisites*

1. Make sure the data in your 2 Traffic Ops databases are synced to avoid getting false positives.
2. Modify test.config with proper settings. Set perform_snapshot=1 if you want to force a snapshot in both Traffic Ops instances.

*Running the Test*

1. `./cfg_test.pl getref test.config` your ref files go into `/tmp/files/ref`
2. `./cfg_test.pl getnew test.config` your new files go into `/tmp/files/new`
3. `./cfg_test.pl compare test.config` - all `not ok` lines should be explained.

It will compare all files for all profiles, _including_ the CRConfig.json.
